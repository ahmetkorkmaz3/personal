I'm a software engineer, who is passionate about web technologies, open source, and building things. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.

I have experience in developing web applications with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and other modern technologies. I'm also interested in DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud computing.

I'm currently working at [Moneo](https://itsmoneo.com) as a Software Engineer.
