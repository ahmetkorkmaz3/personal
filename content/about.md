I'm a software engineer who is passionate about web technologies, open source, and building things. I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.

I have experience in PHP and JavaScript ecosystems. I develop web applications using PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony. I'm also experienced in frontend development with JavaScript, Vue.js, and React.js technologies. I have a special interest in writing tests, clean code practices, and software architecture.

I'm currently working at [Moneo](https://itsmoneo.com) as a Software Engineer.
